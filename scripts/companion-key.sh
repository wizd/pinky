# Makes the release signing key of Pinky for Android (app.pinky.companion,
# called Pinky Companion before November 2026), keeps a copy in 1Password
# and sets the release workflow's secrets COMPANION_KEYSTORE and
# COMPANION_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD with it (docs/RELEASING.md › Setting it up):
#
#   scripts/companion-key.sh
#
# The key: one RSA 4096 key in a PKCS12 keystore under the alias
# pinky-companion, with a certificate for CN=Pinky Companion, O=Pinky,
# valid for 30 years, and a random password, which is the key's too. It
# never touches a file or a command line: it lives in this process's
# variables and goes through pipes (printf is zsh's builtin) to 1Password
# (op, the 1Password CLI, which asks the person to allow it) and GitHub
# (gh). The copy in 1Password is checked before the secrets are set. It
# prints only public facts: the certificate and the name Android shows for
# its signer.
#
# OP_ACCOUNT (rsshub) and OP_VAULT (Employee) say where 1Password keeps the
# copy, REPO (DIYgod/pinky) the repository. A new key replaces the one in
# the secrets: copies of Pinky for Android signed with the old one cannot
# be updated by releases signed with the new one, so Pinky replaces each of
# them once.
