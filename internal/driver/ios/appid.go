// Naming the app on screen. A read starts from remoteAXService's frontmost
// application element, whose process is looked up in the process list and
// the app catalog. Two things went wrong with that in the field:
//
//   - The first read of a session named the app without its bundle id
//     ("Plasma One", item 27): the lookup failed once, and the element's
//     label was all there was. Blocking by bundle id cannot work on such a
//     read, so a lookup that fails now falls back to the catalog by name,
//     and a process the catalog does not list refreshes it once.
//   - While Face ID's prompt or its fade-out was in front of an app, the
//     frontmost application was SpringBoard ("Home Screen") or a process
//     with no name, and the screen still showed the app beneath (OCR read
//     its balances; item 14). A blocked app would leak. When the frontmost
//     process is not an app from the home screen, the app the system has in
//     the foreground beneath it is named instead, from the accessibility
//     daemon's app states: the screen is still that app's, with something
//     of the system's in front.

// appListWait bounds the wait for the daemon's first app state, in tests.
