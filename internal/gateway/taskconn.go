// Connections chosen for one task. An iPhone on iOS 27 left on Automatic
// (Settings › Phones) runs over CoreDevice, which streams its screen, so
// apps that refuse screen sharing do not run while an agent works there.
// When the phone has the WebDriverAgent helper too, a task can move to the
// helper for such apps and back afterwards, without the person changing
// the setting:
//
//   - the agent asks for it: phone_connect's connection "helper", or
//     "coredevice" to go back;
//   - Pinky asks for it: phone_launch opens an app known to refuse screen
//     sharing (refusesSharing), once the gate and the rules let the launch
//     run (execute).
//
// A move never starts while the person is in control, the phone is
// locked, an approval is open or the agent may only watch (mayMove): it
// would cut the person's session and stream for nothing.
//
// The move is the same reconnect as a change in Settings › Phones
// (SetConnection), but nothing is saved: the phone goes back to the
// person's choice when the task ends (switchBackAfter later, so tasks in a
// row stay on the helper), when the person changes the setting, or when
// Pinky restarts. A connection the person chose by hand is kept: tasks ask
